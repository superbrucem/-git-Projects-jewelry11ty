        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Founded in 1985, Ottawa Opal Shop began as a small family-owned jewelry store with a passion for unique, high-quality pieces. Our founder, Dean Aaron, had a vision to create a jewelry store that offered not just beautiful pieces, but also exceptional craftsmanship and personalized service.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Over the years, we've grown from our humble beginnings to become one of Ottawa's most trusted names in fine jewelry. While we've expanded our collection and our team, we've never lost sight of our core values: quality, craftsmanship, and customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Today, we continue to source the finest materials and work with skilled artisans to create jewelry that celebrates life's special moments. Each piece in our collection is carefully selected or designed to ensure it meets our exacting standards.
