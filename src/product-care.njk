                <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Opal Care</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Opals contain water and can crack if they dry out or are exposed to sudden temperature changes. Avoid heat, direct sunlight, and dry conditions. Clean with a soft, damp cloth only. Never use ultrasonic cleaners, harsh chemicals, or soak opals in water for extended periods.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Sterling silver naturally tarnishes over time. Clean with a silver polishing cloth or silver cleaner specifically designed for jewelry. Store silver jewelry in anti-tarnish bags or with anti-tarnish strips to slow tarnishing.</p>
